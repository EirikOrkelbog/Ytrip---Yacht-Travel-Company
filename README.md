I took inspiration from this image: https://dribbble.com/shots/14610615-Website-Design-Concept-Yacht-Travel-Company/attachments/6303316?mode=media 
Some layouts are copied from the image, while others are designed by me.

I found it difficult to decide what content should go in the settings schema. I went with the content that only was displayed on the homepage or rarely updated, but I probably should have put the navigation and footer in the settings. 
I think the content on the homepage isn't loaded yet when i click on the faq and contact navigation links from another page. Therefor it won't scroll down to the correct section.
